Tips for Customization
- Expand Command Set: can add more commands or features. For example, integrate more advanced AI capabilities using OpenAIâ€™s models or integrate with other APIs.
- Enhance AI Interaction: can adjust how your AI interacts with users, such as allowing it to engage in more natural conversation.
- plan to eventually have a GUI of its own or add a physical component like a speaker (of course for personal use)
